안녕하세요! 블로그 테스트 중입니다.   
너무너무 즐겁네요 ㅎㅎㅎ

Wow! I love blogging so much already.

Did you know that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))

Yeah, I didn't either.
